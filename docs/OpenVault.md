# What is OpenVault?

**OpenVault** is an Obsidian vault that is a research project about research. The idea behind it is that it can be placed as an ad-hoc to a current obsidian vault. But should remain clean of personalized information to remain open. This is great in scenarios there one does not want to combine work/personal information with research, and/or to keep the research aspect clean and not cluttered with work/personal information.
